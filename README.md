# UK Covid Tracker
I created a UK Covid Tracker for Android, developed in Kotlin using Android Studio.    

This project uses retrofit, gson, and RobinHood's spark to retrieve JSON data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ and display it as a line graph for four different variables: 

 * Daily Cases
 * Cumulative Cases
 * Daily Deaths
 * Cumulative Deaths
