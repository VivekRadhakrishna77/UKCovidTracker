# UK Covid Tracker
I created a UK Covid Tracker for Android, developed in Kotlin using Android Studio. 
This project uses retrofit, gson, and RobinHood's spark to retrieve JSON data from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/ and display it as a line graph for four different variables: 
 *Daily Cases
 *Cumulative Cases
 *Daily Deaths
 *Cumulative Deaths
